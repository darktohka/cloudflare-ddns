cloudflare-ddns
===============

*Deprecated*: A newer repository is available, implementing the functionality of this project in Bash.

Introduction
------------

A script for dynamically updating a CloudFlare DNS record.  I use CloudFlare
to host DNS for a domain and I wanted to point an A record in that domain to
a host whose IP address changes occasionally.  CloudFlare has an API to do this,
so this project was created.

This repository is no longer maintained. Please use the Bash version instead.
